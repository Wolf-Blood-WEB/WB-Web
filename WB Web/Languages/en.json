  "play-obj-p1": "<span class='notranslate'>Wolfblood</span> is a digital version of the classic \"Werewolf\" game, played via a Telegram bot. This game combines elements of strategy, cooperation, and hidden identities, and can be played with a minimum of 5 people. Players take on different roles, and each person's goal is to ensure their group survives and to eliminate their opponents.",
  "play-obj-h3": "Roles and Objectives",
  "play-obj-h4-1": "1. Villagers 👨‍🌾:",
  "play-obj-p2": "The primary objective of the villagers is to uncover the elements of evil in the village and neutralize them through lynching. During this process, careful observation, logical discussion, and analyzing the behavior of other players are crucial. Villagers can only eliminate wolves or other evil roles with accurate guesses.",
  "play-obj-h4-2": "2. Wolves 🐺:",
  "play-obj-p3": "The goal of the wolves is to equal or exceed the number of villagers. They move secretly during the night, attempting to neutralize villagers. Strategy and cooperation are very important for the wolves, as one wrong move can lead to a decrease in their pack size and a loss of the game.",
  "play-obj-h4-3": "3. Solo Evils 🎭:",
  "play-obj-p4": "Some roles are called \"solo evils,\" and their objective is to survive on their own. These players do not side with either the villagers or the wolves; their strategies are entirely self-serving. Solo evils aim to survive until the end of the game by manipulating other players and acting with caution.",
  "play-phase-h3": "Game Phases",
  "play-phase-h4-1": "1. Night (Action Phase) 🌙:",
  "play-phase-p1": "During the night phase, roles with special abilities become active. As the wolves secretly choose their victims, some special roles can also use their abilities. This phase takes place in complete silence, and the players' actions are hidden from others.",
  "play-phase-h4-2": "2. Day (Discussion Phase) ☀️:",
  "play-phase-p2": "When day arrives, villagers and other roles discuss what happened during the night, evaluate clues, and debate who is suspicious. This phase highlights strategic and persuasive skills; the right analysis can determine the fate of the game.",
  "play-phase-h4-3": "3. Lynch (Hanging Phase) ⚖️:",
  "play-phase-p3": "Following the discussions, the villagers and some other roles decide to eliminate a player from the game by lynching them. Lynching is a critical step to reduce the evil in the village, but wrong decisions can make the job easier for the wolves and evil roles.",
  "play-strat-h3": "Strategy and Tips",
  "play-strat-li1": "Players should carefully watch the behavior of others and adjust their strategies accordingly.",
  "play-strat-li2": "While wolves maintain secrecy, villagers should gain an advantage through cooperation and logical deduction.",
  "play-strat-li3": "Solo evil roles must be careful and patient to manipulate everyone.",
  "play-strat-p1": "The game offers a dynamic experience that combines logic, communication, and strategy at every stage. <span class='notranslate'>Wolfblood</span> is full of different strategies and surprises in every round. Players hiding their identities, forming alliances, and trying to outsmart the opposing side make the game both exciting and challenging.",
  "play-rules-h3": "General Rules",
  "play-rules-p1": "To ensure a fair and enjoyable game for everyone, all players must adhere to the following rules:",
  "play-rules-li1": "<b>No Cheating:</b> Using multiple accounts (multi-accounting) in a single game is strictly forbidden.",

  "play-rules-li3": "<b>Respect All Players:</b> Harassment, flooding, spamming, personal insults, or any form of toxic behavior will not be tolerated.",
  "play-rules-li4": "<b>No External Communication:</b> Do not share game-related information (like your role, who you targeted, or screenshots) with other players outside of the main game chat (e.t., in private messages), unless your role (like Mason or Werewolf) allows it.",

  "roles-main-desc": "Wolf Blood is basically based on 3 teams. The Villagers, the Werewolves and the Solo Roles who go it alone. Each team wins as a team by cooperating. The Village team must lynch and eliminate the Werewolves with unity and the right strategic moves. The Wolf Pack can win by disguising their identities and convincing the villagers to believe them, eliminating each player. Solo roles are on their own and have their own goals. Solo Killers, on the other hand, must eliminate all players in the game, regardless of team or role. Click on the buttons to see the roles and detailed descriptions of each team.",
