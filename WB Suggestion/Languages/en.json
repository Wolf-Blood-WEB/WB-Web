On the first try you will kill the wise elder, the serial killer, the arsonist, even the cursed. If you have visitors, they will either die or be infected and turn into werewolves the next day.

If a villager tries to kill him, he will reveal someone's role to the person trying to kill him and will survive thanks to this deal. No deal if he is lynched. He will do the same thing to survive the wolves. This can only happen once, so the second time he risks being killed he will die. The serial killer will kill him outright.",

If one of the roles in the village visits him, he will slaughter the villagers like a serial killer. If one of the evil roles visits him, he will have no kill function and will be re-teamed with him. He will aim for absolute victory with his partner. They can either finish last together and win or not win at all.",

  "desc_depressive": "Burdened by high-level anxiety and extreme stress, this player is unaware of their true condition and believes they are just an ordinary Villager. If they die by normal means, nothing happens. However, if another player is lynched but this player still received votes during the trial, they suffer a severe panic attack. In a blind frenzy, they will inadvertently cause the death of a random player who voted for them. Consumed by paranoia after the incident, they will succumb to the unbearable stress and take their own life the following day. 😔",

This thing will not appear every game but if it appears, it will not go until someone gets bitten.",
  "desc_shadow_master": "At first night you have two choices; you can prefer to hide from incoming attacks, or you can possess someone’s body. If they have any night action you will take over their role entire game and your target will die as “devoured”. From that moment you cannot defend yourself and you can only use the role ability, or you must back your pure form. If your targets do not have any night action, they will die, and you will look for new prey. You will win if you succeed in being the last player in the game.",
  "desc_dna_sampler": "On the 2nd night, you will choose someone to take as a reference.
